This project reproduces the problem of Rave handling relative paths.

To run this example, you need the following:

* Java 7 or higher
* Maven 3
* Bower

To reproduce:

. Clone this repository
. `cd /your/path/to/this/repo`
. `cd src/main/resources/static`
. `bower install`
. `cd /base/of/this/repo`
. `mvn spring-boot:run`

With everything running, you should be able to see the issue at hand.

. Navigate to http://localhost:8080 with your browser.
. Open JavaScript console. This page should have loaded just fine with Rave REPL on display.
. Now navigate to the link at http://localhost:8080/subUrl/RaveJS.
. It will render the page with RaveJS, but the console will show boot.js to not load properly.

Spring MVC will have shifted the local path to */subUrl*. RaveJS picks up and runs with that as the baseURI, which wrecks everything.
